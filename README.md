## Child Welfare Insights Analysis

### Problem Statement

In the critical domain of child welfare, gaining insights into child abuse cases is essential. This project aims to analyze a dataset named "Data," which captures detailed information about child abuse cases across different states, including relevant childcare factors. The primary challenge is to comprehensively analyze this dataset, extract meaningful insights, and create a model that enhances decision-making in the context of child protection.

### Objective

The main objectives of this project are:
- To gain insights into child abuse cases across various states.
- To focus on different factors associated with childcare.
- To visualize the data in a way that facilitates understanding and decision-making.

### Features

The project includes the following key analyses and visualizations:

1. **DAX Calculations**:
- Creation of a measure table for enhanced data analytics.

2. **Data Visualizations**:
- **Column Chart**: Display the top 5 states with child care providers.
- **Doughnut Chart**: Illustrate the top states with the highest child legal guidance.
- **Funnel Chart**: Highlight the top 5 states with perpetrators.
- **Column Chart**: Show the top 6 states with the highest number of parents.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Create cards for:
- Total Parents
- Total States
- Top Perpetrators
- Total Unmarried Parents
- Total Foster Parents
- Total Child Day Care Providers
- Total Multiple Relationships

### Tools Used

- Data visualization software (mention the specific software if applicable, e.g., Power BI, Tableau)
- Language for DAX calculations (e.g., DAX, SQL)
- Python/R (if programming languages are used for data manipulation)

### Visual Themes

Customize various charts with preferred colors and themes, ensuring readability and clarity in the analysis of the given data.

### Project Completion

Upon completion of the project, a post will be shared on LinkedIn, along with screenshots of the visualizations, to showcase the findings and prompt further discussion.
